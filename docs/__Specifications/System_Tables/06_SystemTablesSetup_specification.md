# System Tables Setup (Reference)

Purpose: If/when the app introduces system tables, follow project-scoped preferences and RLS.

Key Points:
- Project scoping via composite keys when applicable
- Preferences stored under project-scoped keys
- Availability vs visibility separation
- Use typed RPCs for metadata operations
