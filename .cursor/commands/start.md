# /start — New Task Bootstrap (Strings Project)

## REQUIRED: Read These Files Completely First
1. docs/__Plans_New/architecture-spec-v4.md
2. docs/__Plans_New/AI_RULES.md
3. docs/__Specifications/09_SupabaseDataRetrieval_specification.md


## Critical Rules
- Do NOT begin implementation before confirming you have read the four documents above end-to-end.
- Enforce: component size < 1500 LOC; stable useEffect deps; type hierarchy; strict SSR Supabase pattern via @supabase/ssr.
- No exec_sql. Use typed RPCs or typed selects.
- Respect liquid-glass design system classes for UI.

## Execution
- After reading, confirm:

✅ Architecture patterns loaded
✅ Critical rules internalized
✅ System table patterns understood
✅ Database best practices ready
✅ Ready to build exceptional code

- Then produce a concise plan (or proceed if already planned), listing files to edit/create and acceptance criteria.
- Avoid starting dev server automatically; prefer npx tsc --noEmit and npm run lint for checks.
